# SFLOW-1: sFlow Configuration and Sampling

## Summary

Verify configuration of sflow and sFlow sample data.

## Procedure

* SFLOW-1.1 Configure sFlow on DUT
  * Configure DUT to send sflow samples to ATE port 2
  * Set sample source address, sample size 256Bytes, one sample per 1M packets and DSCP=32

* SFLOW-1.2 Send traffic via OTG and verify sFlow packet on OTG
  * Configure ATE to generate ipv4 and ipv6 traffic and capture sFlow packets
    * Traffic Profile
        | Traffic Item | PPS    | Packet Size | L3  | L4  |
        | ------------ | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- |
        | sflow1       | 1000   | 64          | IP  | TCP |
        | sflow2       | 10000  | 64          | IP  | TCP |
        | sflow3       | 100000 | 64          | IP  | TCP |
        | mflow1       | 1000   | 512         | IP  | TCP |
        | mflow2       | 10000  | 512         | IP  | TCP |
        | mflow3       | 100000 | 512         | IP  | TCP |
        | lflow1       | 1000   | 1500        | IP  | TCP |
        | lflow2       | 10000  | 1500        | IP  | TCP |
        | lflow3       | 100000 | 1500        | IP  | TCP |

* Verify captured packet is formatted like an sFlow packet
* Verify sample size is 256B
* Verify 1 sample sent to collector address per 1M packets generated by ATE
* Verify sample packet is set with DSCP=32
