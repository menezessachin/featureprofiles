Summary: 
 - BGP route reflector capabilities check
 - Ensure functionality of different OC paths for "supported-capabilities", "BGP peer-type", "BGP Neighbor details" and "BGP transport session parameters"

Topology:
ATE (Port1) <--> (Port1) DUT (Port2) <--> (Port2) ATE
  - Connect ATE Port1 to DUT port1
  - Connect ATE Port2 to DUT port2

Procedure:
  - Establish IS-IS adjacency between ATE Port1 and DUT Port1. 
  - Establish BGP sessions as follows between ATE and DUT . 
    - ATE port 1 is emulating RRC peered with the DUT acting as the RR server. DUT's loopback address should be used for the IBGP peering and 
      "transport/config/local-address" OC path should be used on DUT to configure BGP transport address. ATE address used for the IBGP peering (different from ATE port1 address) and DUT 
      loopback addresses should be reachable via IS-IS
    - The DUT has eBGP peering with ATE port 2 and is receiving 20M IPv4 and 5M IPv6 routes. The DUT should automatically determine the BGP transport source address based on the nearest interface.
      Hence, the OC path "transport/config/local-address" shouldnt be used.
  - Validate session state on ATE ports and DUT using telemetry.
    - The check should also include accurately receiving values for the path "transport/state/local-address" for RRC as well as for the EBGP peering
    - Validate accuracy of the peer-type leaf (neighbor/config/peer-type) for EBGP and IBGP peering.
  - Validate session state and capabilities received on DUT using telemetry.
  - Validate the BGP route/path attributes
