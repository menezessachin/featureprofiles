Summary:
  - When operating in "openconfig mode", NOS (network operating system) defaults should match what OC defines as the defaults i.e. BGP AFI-SAFI are not enabled by default.
    This test currently only verifies the defaults for ipv4-unicast and ipv6-unicast AFI-SAFI implementations. However, this test can be extended further to cover for other
    AFI/SAFIs as well.
  - The test will check for default implementations under the neighbor and peer-group hierarchies.


Topology:
ATE (Port1) <-EBGP-> (Port1) DUT (Port2) <-IBGP-> (Port2) ATE
  - Connect ATE Port1 to DUT port1 (EBGP peering)
  - Connect ATE Port2 to DUT port2 (IBGP peering)

Procedure:
  - [Test case-1] IPv4-unicast Enabled, IPv6-Unicast disabled at neighbor level:
    - Push EBGP and IBGP OC configuration to the DUT 
      -  Configuration should include corresponding IPv4 and IPv6 neighbor configurations.
      -  Ensure that only IPv4-Unicast enabled boolean is made "true". IPv6-unicast is left to OC default which is "Disabled". 
    - Ensure that only IPv4-unicast AFI-SAFI neighborship is in "established" state. Test is a fail if the IPv6-unicast neighbor is also in "established" state.
  - [Test case-2] IPv6-unicast Enabled, IPv4-Unicast disabled at neighbor level:
    - Repeat the same steps as above in "Test case-1" but this time with "IPv4-Unicast enabled" boolean as OC-default and "IPv6-Unicast enabled" boolean as true.
    - Ensure that only IPv6-unicast AFI-SAFI neighborship is in "established" state. Test is a fail if the IPv4-unicast neighbor is also in "established" state.
  - [Test case-3] IPv4-unicast Enabled, IPv6-Unicast disabled at peer-group level:
    - Conduct the same test as "Test case-1" but this time at the peer-group level. Peer-groups configured for both IBGP and EBGP neighbors.
  - [Test case-4] IPv6-unicast Enabled, IPv4-Unicast disabled at peer-group level:
    - Conduct the same test as "Test case-2" but this time at the peer-group level. Peer-groups configured for both IBGP and EBGP neighbors.
